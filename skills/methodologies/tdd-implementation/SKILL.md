# Test-Driven Development

## When to Use

Use this skill when implementing features requiring high reliability, refactoring existing code, or fixing bugs with regression prevention.

## The TDD Cycle

Red Phase - Write a failing test that defines expected behavior
Green Phase - Write minimal code to make the test pass  
Refactor Phase - Improve code structure while keeping tests green

## Best Practices

Write one test at a time. Keep tests focused and atomic. Test behavior not implementation. Run tests frequently. Maintain fast test suite.

## Test Structure

Arrange - Set up test preconditions
Act - Execute the behavior under test
Assert - Verify expected outcomes

## When to Use TDD

New feature development, bug fixes requiring regression tests, refactoring legacy code, API development, complex business logic.
