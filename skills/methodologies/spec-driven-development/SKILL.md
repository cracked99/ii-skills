# Specification-Driven Development

## When to Use

Use this skill when creating new features, APIs, or components that benefit from formal specification before implementation.

## Core Principles

Specifications are the source of truth. All code must trace back to documented requirements.

## Workflow

1. Gather Requirements - Collect and document all requirements from stakeholders
2. Write Specification - Create formal spec document with interfaces, types, and behaviors
3. Review Specification - Validate spec covers all requirements
4. Implement to Spec - Write code that implements the specification exactly
5. Verify Implementation - Ensure code matches specification

## Specification Document Structure

Title and version, requirements list, interface definitions, type definitions, behavior descriptions, acceptance criteria, edge cases and error handling.

## Best Practices

Keep specs versioned alongside code. Update specs before changing implementation. Use specs as the basis for tests. Reference spec sections in code comments.
