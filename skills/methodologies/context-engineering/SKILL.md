# Context Engineering

## When to Use

Use this skill when managing AI context windows, optimizing prompts for code generation, or working with large codebases.

## Core Principles

Context is a limited resource. Load only what is needed. Search before reading. Prioritize relevant information.

## Techniques

Lazy Loading - Search and grep before reading full files
Context Pruning - Remove irrelevant information from context
Hierarchical Loading - Load summaries first, details on demand
Reference Linking - Point to files rather than including full content

## Best Practices

Start with project structure overview. Use targeted searches. Load only relevant code sections. Summarize large files. Keep context focused on current task.
