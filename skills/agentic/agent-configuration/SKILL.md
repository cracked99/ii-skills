# Agent Configuration

## When to Use

Use this skill when setting up AI agent parameters, writing system prompts, or defining behavioral constraints.

## Configuration Elements

System Prompt - Core instructions and personality
Tools - Available capabilities and their configurations  
Constraints - Behavioral limits and safety guidelines
Memory - Context management and persistence settings

## Best Practices

Keep system prompts focused. Define clear tool boundaries. Specify explicit constraints. Manage context efficiently.

## Common Patterns

Task-specific agents with narrow focus. General agents with broad capabilities. Specialized agents for specific domains. Orchestrator agents for coordination.
