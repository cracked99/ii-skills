# DSPy Signatures

## When to Use

Use this skill when designing type-safe, composable AI modules with clear input/output contracts.

## Core Concept

Signatures define the interface between AI modules - what inputs they accept and what outputs they produce.

## Signature Structure

Input fields with types and descriptions. Output fields with types and descriptions. Optional constraints and examples.

## Benefits

Type safety for AI pipelines. Composable modules. Clear contracts. Testable interfaces.

## Best Practices

Keep signatures focused. Use descriptive field names. Include field descriptions. Compose simple signatures into complex workflows.
