# TextGrad Correction

## When to Use

Use this skill when implementing iterative improvement loops for AI-generated content, code, or other outputs.

## Core Concept

Use gradient-like feedback to iteratively improve text outputs. Analyze errors, generate corrections, apply improvements.

## Workflow

1. Generate Initial Output
2. Evaluate Against Criteria
3. Generate Correction Feedback
4. Apply Corrections
5. Repeat Until Satisfactory

## Benefits

Iterative improvement. Explicit feedback loops. Measurable progress. Quality convergence.

## Best Practices

Define clear evaluation criteria. Generate specific feedback. Apply targeted corrections. Track improvement over iterations.
